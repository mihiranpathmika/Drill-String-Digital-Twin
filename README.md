Thanks for visiting this repository. This gives a guidance to run HMM tool box by Kevin Murphy and run the example vibration classification on your own computer.
This repository consists with 3 files: 1.) HMM tool box 2.) The bond grah simulations for each vibration type 2.) The training and testing data acquired by the Bond graph simulations and the apparatus mentioned in the video.

HMMM tool box
-------------
1.) You can open Matlab and navigate to HMM folder (Path: HMMall/HMM)
2.) Then open classifier.m file
3.) Load the data set in to the workspace
4.) Find and replace all the "C:\Users\HMMall" with your actual path to the folder.
5.) Run!
6.) If you need to test a different vibration classification, change the testing data set in Line number 238.
7.) Enjoy!

Bond Graph Simulations
----------------------
You can download 20 Sim through this link (https://www.20sim.com/download/) for testing purposes
Simply download the .emx files and run to generate the simulation data which are used to train the classifier.


Training and Testing data set
------------------------------
This data set includes the data egenerated by the bondgraph simulations and the experimental data from the apparatus shown in the video.

Good luck!
